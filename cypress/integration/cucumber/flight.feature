      And I navigate to search flight form
      And I search the flight from "London" to "New York"
      And I book the first flight from the list
      And I confirm the booking with passenger data
      Then Booking status should be "Unpaid"
      When I choose pay on arrival
      Then Booking status should be "Reserved"
